hubot-passivetotal-scripts
==========================

These scripts provide you with the same tools exposed through our PassiveTotal ![API](https://www.passivetotal.org/api/docs). In order to make use of the scripts, you will need to obtain an API key. You can do this by ![registering](https://www.passivetotal.org/register) on our website.

## Environment Variable
You can set your API key using an environment variable or through the bot once you have it up and running.

If you choose to use the env variable, please use "PASSIVETOTAL_API_KEY".
